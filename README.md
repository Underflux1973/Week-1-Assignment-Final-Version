REFLECIONS ON THIS WEEEKS ASSIGNMENT

Overall I feel reasonably happy with my progress on this assignment. The page I have created is fairly similar to the ideas I visualised in my mind. That said there are still some aspects of my work and the coding that seem a little clunky which I will endeavour to explain below in more detail.

- 1.1 - The navigation menu is not entirely as I would have liked. You can see that i added some opacity to the navigation flexbox which is all good - but it then added the opacity to the text contained within the flexbox. As I write this I am thinking that to resolve this I would need to create a separate container for the text so I can style the text and parent flexbox independently - I shall await your feedback on this!

- 1.2 - Looking at my css I am beginning to think I could have simplified this a bit more, particularly with the flexboxes containing the text in the different sections.

- 1.3 - The autoplay functionality on the audio that I have embedded into my web page doesn't work automatically.  It does play audio but it requires the visitor/client user to press the play button.  Having read some documentation via MDN docs, I can see that lots of browsers don't allow autoplay and seem to block it - due to issues with ads and also from a user experience, it isn't always best to have audio playing immediately when you visit a website/web page. 

- 1.4 - In regards to CSS, I found out that you could create multiple classes for an element by writing the class labels and simply seperating with a space in the HTML e.g. <section id="events" class="events image-printworks"> this has saved quite a bit of time in the flow. 

- 1.5 - I am getting better at finding the common issues that occur in coding e.g. no closing div, misssing /, wrong file path name. Or not nesting an element in the correct way. 

- 1.6 - You'll see that my social media icons in the footer are not visible. I ran out of time to fix this. 

FINAL THOUGHTS 

I can see that I will need to spend more time just simply trying things out and continuing to practice coding in spare momemts outside the class hours. I can see that I get easily distracted with design elements, when actually my priority is sometimes just to get something working first - then to look at the design.
